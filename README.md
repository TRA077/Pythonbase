To begin you must have python installed in your pc. You can do so by simply going to [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) here you could simply download the latest version of python and go through the installation procedures and finally run the program.
You could also simply use vscode(download and install from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)). Install related python extension, create a file, debug and start coding. Visit [this page](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial) for more information.<br />
